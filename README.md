- main.bpf.c : Rusty kernel part
- main.rs : main structures (scheduler, parameters the user can change)
- tuner.rs : the high-frequency tuning part
- see topology.rs and domain.rs for the way some variables are initialized (nr_doms, nr_cpus) and the way they create the topology
- rusty_saakm.c for what i tried to implement, got an average of 1.254s for 10 runs with hackbench (no crash) and 4 CPUs with qemu
- cfs_eevdf.drawio for the structures and fonctoins called for the vruntime computations
- rapport_rusty.drawio for a diagram of rusty_select_cpu and the cpumask they use
- rusty_tables.drawio to see all their tables ðŸ’€
